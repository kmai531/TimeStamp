Your task for this milestone is to identify and describe an interesting challenge for which a PWA would be an appropriate solution. You will then write a brief project proposal that contains:

A title for your project.
The problem or need that your proposed PWA addresses. Who are the target users and why would they use your app?
The general features your application provides. What are the things users will be able to accomplish with your app? What data do you need for this to work and how will you get it?
Include supporting draft wireframes of the main views illustrating how you envision your application will work.
There is no specific length requirement, but as a rough estimate your proposal should be about a page and a half in length (if you were to print it), excluding the wireframes.

Remember that this is a team effort. At the end of your proposal, include a section where you describe your individual team members' contributions for the proposal, and any plans for dividing work in the future, if any (e.g., someone may have experience with graphic design or databases).
