Your task for this milestone is to identify and describe an interesting challenge for which a PWA would be an appropriate solution. You will then write a brief project proposal that contains:

A title for your project.
The problem or need that your proposed PWA addresses. Who are the target users and why would they use your app?
The general features your application provides. What are the things users will be able to accomplish with your app? What data do you need for this to work and how will you get it?
Include supporting draft wireframes of the main views illustrating how you envision your application will work.
There is no specific length requirement, but as a rough estimate your proposal should be about a page and a half in length (if you were to print it), excluding the wireframes.

Remember that this is a team effort. At the end of your proposal, include a section where you describe your individual team members' contributions for the proposal, and any plans for dividing work in the future, if any (e.g., someone may have experience with graphic design or databases).

# Timestamp, a personal and business time management software

## Problem Statement & Target Audience

The problem that the project seeks to solve is to allow for ways for employees to keep track of their time and ensure that they get paid the correct amount of money that they should have received. Originally, the project was intended for NC State student workers to keep track of their total number of hours worked, as there is no means to keep track of that through MyPack Portal and student workers instead must keep track of their hours on their own using an Excel spreadsheet as an example. With this application, it will state the total number of hours worked for the student for an entire semester or year so as to not run over the allocated work hours for a student. This idea got expanded further with Michaelâ€™s input, stating that it can be used as a way for businesses to properly pay their employees on time. As such, the target audience would be for businesses/organizations/the government and its respective employees and the application functions as a payroll application.

## Project Overview & Functionality
The general features that the application will provide will be an authentication and authorization function for employees to log in and log their times and what they have done for the day to keep track of the hours that they have worked.

In order to keep track of times, there will be three options. The employee can enter the time manually in hours and minutes that they calculated themselves, the employee can enter the start time and end time and the application will calculate the hours and minutes for the employee, or the employee can choose to clock in and clock out with the application and it will save the start and end times.

The employee will also have access to some account settings for better customization of their account and some statistics. In addition, employees will be able to view their logs that they have submitted for the time worked.

For businesses, they will be able to search through a database of workers and examine the amount of hours that they have worked for a period of time from where the employee had been last paid to the time that the employers look at the employee hours. The employer can choose to send the payment as calculated by the application to the employees to ensure that they are paid on time.

## Data Needed & How It Is Obtained
Businesses will also be able to add employees to their business in order to add them to their respective database of employees. For this data to work, the system will need business names, usernames, and passwords to start out. Other personal information may be added when necessary, such as first name, last name, and date of birth. To obtain this information, the users will simply need to register an account as an employee or register a whole business. If a business is registered, then they use a generated code to register themselves as a business. Other data includes timestamps and time worked in terms of hours and minutes. This will be collected from employees that log their times into the database, which calculates the sum of the hours and minutes worked, which will in turn be shown to the employers for when it is time to pay the employees.

## Contributions
So far, there have been contributions from all team members for working on the wireframes and its respective transitions. Dylan was the one who came up with the initial project proposal before the idea was extended further by Michael. We also brainstormed to get the optimal app name. In terms of dividing work in the future, there are no tentative plans in place as of yet.
